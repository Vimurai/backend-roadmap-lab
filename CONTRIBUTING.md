# Contributing to Backend Roadmap Lab

We love contributions! Whether it's fixing a typo, adding a new analogy, or creating a new challenge.

## Guidelines
1.  **Analogies First:** If explaining a complex topic, start with a real-world analogy.
2.  **Test-Driven:** Every code challenge must have a failing test that the learner needs to make pass.
3.  **Scaffolding:** Do not provide the full solution in `src/`. Provide stubs with `// TODO` comments.

## Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a feature branch.
3.  Submit a PR with a clear description of the learning value added.

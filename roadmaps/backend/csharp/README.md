# C# .NET Backend Roadmap 🛤️

Welcome to the C# track. This path takes you from "Console.WriteLine" to high-throughput distributed systems.

This curriculum is heavily inspired by the industry-standard **Backend Developer Roadmap** (roadmap.sh). We have converted those theoretical boxes into practical code labs.

## 🗺️ Topic to Lab Mapping

Use this table to find the lab corresponding to a roadmap concept.

## 🧭 How to Navigate
1.  **Start Linear:** If you are a beginner, follow the folders in numerical order (`00` -> `19`). They build upon each other.
2.  **Jump In:** If you are an experienced developer needing to learn a specific topic (e.g., "How does RabbitMQ work in .NET?"), jump directly to `15-message-brokers`.
3.  **The "Missing" Link:** We added `04-dotnet-and-tooling` early on because you need to master the CLI and Debugger before building complex APIs.

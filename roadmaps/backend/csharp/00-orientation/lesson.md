# 00 Orientation: The Engineer's Cockpit

## 🧠 Mental Model: The Pilot & The Cockpit
Imagine you are a **pilot** (the engineer). To fly the plane (the software), you don't just grab the wings and flap them. You sit in a **cockpit** full of instruments.

- **The Terminal:** Your control stick. It looks scary, but it's the fastest way to tell the plane what to do.
- **VS Code:** Your navigation system and gauges. It shows you the state of the engine (code).
- **Dotnet CLI:** The engine starter.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. The Terminal (CLI)
The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a menu for customers. The CLI (Command Line Interface) is the kitchen for chefs.
- `ls` / `dir`: "Show me what's on the table."
- `cd`: "Walk into that room."
- `mkdir`: "Build a new box."

### 2. The Feedback Loop
Coding is a loop:
1.  **Write** (in Editor)
2.  **Run** (in Terminal)
3.  **Read Error** (Analysis)
4.  **Repeat**

### 3. Environment Variables
Secret notes your computer keeps in its pocket. Example: `PATH` tells the computer where to look for tools.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- **Fear of the Black Box:** Avoiding the terminal because "it looks like hacking."
- **Wrong Directory:** Trying to cook dinner while standing in the bathroom. Always check `pwd` (Print Working Directory).
- **Ignoring Errors:** Reading only the last line of an error message instead of the first "Caused by...".

## 📝 Mini Quiz
1.  What does CLI stand for?
2.  Which command changes your current directory?
3.  What happens if you type a command that isn't in your `PATH`?
4.  True or False: You need a mouse to write code.
5.  What is the command to list files in your OS (Mac/Linux vs Windows)?

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks
1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to your Desktop using only the keyboard.
3.  Create a folder named `hacker-den`.
4.  Delete it without opening Finder/Explorer.

## 💭 Reflection
*   Write 3 bullets on what felt "unnatural" about using the CLI today.
*   Write 1 command you memorized.

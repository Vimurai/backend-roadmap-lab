# 11 CI/CD: The Factory Assembly Line

## 🧠 Analogy: The Car Factory
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Every time you make a part, it is immediately measured and checked for quality.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Once the car is built and tested, it is automatically driven to the dealership.

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"Automate the Boring, Secure the Quality."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
- **The Pipeline:** The sequence of steps (Build -> Test -> Deploy).
- **Artifact:** The "Compiled Package" that is ready to be shipped.
- **Environment:** Staging (The test track) vs. Production (The real highway).

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
CI/CD is about **trust**. If your pipeline is green, you should feel 99% confident that your code won't break the site when it goes live.

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions

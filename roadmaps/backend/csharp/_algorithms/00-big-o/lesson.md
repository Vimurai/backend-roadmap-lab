# Algorithm: Big O Notation

## 🧠 Analogy: The Speed Limit Signs

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"Time is Money, Space is Memory."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
Understand how to implement and optimize Big O Notation.

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
Big O is about how the algorithm scales as the data gets bigger, not how fast it is on your specific laptop.

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions
- How would you explain Big O Notation to someone who doesn't code?
- When is Big O Notation the *wrong* choice?

## 📝 Checkpoint Quiz
1. What is the complexity of a single loop?
2. Which is faster: O(N) or O(log N)?
3. What is the Big O complexity of the most common operation here?

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition
- **Practice:** Try to implement this from scratch tomorrow without looking at your notes.

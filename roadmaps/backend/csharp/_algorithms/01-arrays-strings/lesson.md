# Algorithm: Arrays & Strings

## 🧠 Analogy: The Egg Carton

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"Contiguous memory, instant access."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
Understand how to implement and optimize Arrays & Strings.

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
Arrays are fixed size and store items side-by-side. Moving one item in the middle means moving everyone else too.

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions
- How would you explain Arrays & Strings to someone who doesn't code?
- When is Arrays & Strings the *wrong* choice?

## 📝 Checkpoint Quiz
1. What is the cost of inserting at the start of an array?
2. How does a 'Dynamic Array' (List) grow?
3. What is the Big O complexity of the most common operation here?

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition
- **Practice:** Try to implement this from scratch tomorrow without looking at your notes.

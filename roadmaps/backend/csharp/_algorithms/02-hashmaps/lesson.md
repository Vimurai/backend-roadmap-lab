# Algorithm: Hashmaps

## 🧠 Analogy: The Cubby Holes

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"Label it, Store it, Find it (O(1))."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
Understand how to implement and optimize Hashmaps.

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
Hashmaps use a 'Hash Function' to turn a key into an index. It's like having a magical index that takes you exactly to the page you need.

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions
- How would you explain Hashmaps to someone who doesn't code?
- When is Hashmaps the *wrong* choice?

## 📝 Checkpoint Quiz
1. What is a Collision?
2. Why is a good Hash Function important?
3. What is the Big O complexity of the most common operation here?

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition
- **Practice:** Try to implement this from scratch tomorrow without looking at your notes.

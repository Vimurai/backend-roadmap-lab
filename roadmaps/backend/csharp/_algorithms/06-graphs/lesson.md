# Algorithm: Graphs

## 🧠 Analogy: The Social Network

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"Nodes and Edges."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
Understand how to implement and optimize Graphs.

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
Graphs represent relationships. Everyone is a dot (Node), and the lines between them are Edges. Use them for maps, recommendations, and dependencies.

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions
- How would you explain Graphs to someone who doesn't code?
- When is Graphs the *wrong* choice?

## 📝 Checkpoint Quiz
1. What is the difference between Directed and Undirected?
2. What is a 'Cycle' in a graph?
3. What is the Big O complexity of the most common operation here?

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition
- **Practice:** Try to implement this from scratch tomorrow without looking at your notes.

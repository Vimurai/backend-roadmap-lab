# Algorithm: Trees

## 🧠 Analogy: The Corporate Hierarchy

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"Root at the top, leaves at the bottom."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
Understand how to implement and optimize Trees.

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
Trees are recursive. Every 'Branch' is just a smaller tree. This makes them perfect for searching (Binary Search Tree).

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions
- How would you explain Trees to someone who doesn't code?
- When is Trees the *wrong* choice?

## 📝 Checkpoint Quiz
1. What is a 'Balanced' tree?
2. How many children does a Binary Tree node have?
3. What is the Big O complexity of the most common operation here?

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition
- **Practice:** Try to implement this from scratch tomorrow without looking at your notes.

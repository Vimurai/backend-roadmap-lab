# 16 NoSQL: The Notebook

## 🧠 Analogy: The Scrapbook vs. The Spreadsheet
- **SQL (Spreadsheet):** Rigid. Every row must have the same columns.
- **NoSQL (Scrapbook):** Flexible. Page 1 has a photo and text. Page 2 has a ticket stub and a drawing. No predefined structure.

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"SQL for Relationships, NoSQL for Flexibility & Scale."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
- **Document Store (MongoDB):** Storing data as JSON-like documents.
- **Key-Value Store (Redis):** Like a dictionary. Fast but simple.
- **CAP Theorem:** The rule that you can only have two out of three: Consistency, Availability, or Partition Tolerance.

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
NoSQL is not "better" than SQL. It's a **trade-off**. You trade "Strict Relationships" and "ACID transactions" for "Infinite Horizontal Scaling" and "Schema Flexibility".

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions
- When should you choose NoSQL over SQL?
- What does it mean that NoSQL is "Schemaless"?

## 📝 Checkpoint Quiz
1. What does "Base" stand for (NoSQL equivalent of ACID)?
2. What is "Horizontal Scaling"?
3. Name a Document-based database.

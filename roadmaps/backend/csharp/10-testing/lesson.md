# 10 Testing: The Safety Net

## 🧠 Analogy: The Pre-Flight Checklist
An airplane pilot doesn't just "hope" the engines work. They run a **checklist**.
A developer doesn't just "hope" the code works. They run **Tests**.

## 🪝 Memory Hook
> *"Tests are Documentation that can't lie."*

## 📚 Core Concepts
- **Unit Test:** Testing a single "LEGO brick" (method) in isolation.
- **Integration Test:** Testing if two bricks fit together correctly.
- **Mocking:** Creating a "Fake" database or API so you can test your logic without a real connection.

## 💡 If you forget, remember this:
Tests are not about finding bugs today; they are about preventing bugs **tomorrow** when you or a teammate change the code.

## 🗣️ Teach-Back Questions
- Why do we "mock" a database instead of using a real one in unit tests?
- What is TDD (Test-Driven Development)?

## 📝 Checkpoint Quiz
1. What are the "AAA" of a unit test?
2. What does "Code Coverage" measure?
3. Name one popular C# testing framework.

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition
- **Previously:** How does the C# compiler help catch errors before tests even run? (Module 03).
- **Next Week:** Learn how to run these tests automatically in Module 11.

# 🧠 The Learning Method: Analogies & Practice

We believe that deep understanding comes from connecting new information to things you already know.

## 1. The Analogy Anchor
Every lesson starts with a "Mental Hook".
- *Interfaces* are like *Power Outlets*: The wall doesn't care what you plug in, as long as it fits the shape.
- *Dependency Injection* is like a *waiter bringing you food*: You don't go into the kitchen to cook it yourself (instantiate it); you just ask for it (declare it in the constructor).

## 2. The "Broken" Code
We give you code that compiles but doesn't work, or code that is missing a critical piece.
Your job is to be the engineer who fixes it.

## 3. The Green Test
Success is defined by a passing test suite.
`dotnet test` is your dopamine hit.

## 4. Spaced Repetition
Concepts from Module 03 (Language Core) will reappear in Module 12 (Design Patterns), but in a more complex context.
